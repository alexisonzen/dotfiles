Basically like task manager/system monitor in Windows, it displays system information on the desktop.
Setting it up will likely involve also developing a custom .conkyrc file.

Cool-retro-term is a terminal emulator which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens. 
It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.

Tmux allows me to do all that multi-windowed terminal work I've been looking for since I got into
programming. 

# irssi + discord-irc + pidgin + ???

My understanding is that irssi is a favored IRC chat client for linux users. My end goal would be to set it up
so that I can have a chat window in a corner of my screen, like what is often seen with streamers on Twitch or
YouTube, so that I can keep in touch with *everyone* without having to constantly check on so many other 
apps or notifications. I can have my computer open, work in the main window, and whenever I want, switch focus
to the corner window (and expand it if I so desire), and either cycle through the different applications (Group-
Me, Facebook Messenger, Discord, Signal, Twist, etc) or scroll through the conversations/channels that I'm
involved in. All in one. fucking. window.

# cmus

To be honest, I don't have a favored application for this, yet. It's just the first that came up. The concept is
similar to the chat window referenced earlier. It's a single window that manages my music for me. *IF* this
window is able to plug into Spotify/Google Music/whatever, it's golden. The goal is that I can switch focus to
my music window, play the music I want to play, and then get out, all without having to fuss with a million
other things.
